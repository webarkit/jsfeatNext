# jsfeatNext

A testing repository to develop a ES6 version of [jsfeat](https://github.com/inspirit/jsfeat) for the WebARKit project. Consider that this is a test and many things may changes during the development. I will provide some examples for testing.

## List of features

- Typescript definitions

- ES6 support

- webpack bundler

- npm packages

## Classes
These public classes were implemented:
- cache
- fast_corners
- homography2d
- imgproc
- keypoint_t
- linalg
- math
- matmath
- matrix_t
- motion_estimator
- optical_flow_lk
- orb
- pyramid_t
- transform
- yape
- yape06

## npm package
You can install the package with:

`npm install @webarkit/jsfeat-next`

Consider that the package is not well tested and many bugs may arise...

## Future features
Not all the original classes from jsfeat are yet implemented, this will be done in a near future.

## Examples
Go in the examples folder to test some of them.

## Typescript examples

You can find some Typescript examples in this repository [jsfeatNext-examples](https://github.com/webarkit/jsfeatNext-examples). 

## Documentation

There is not yet an official webarkit documentation but you can read the [original jsfeat docs](https://inspirit.github.io/jsfeat/) to have an idea of classes and functions. We tried to be much close as possible to the original code, so if it woks on **jsfeat** it will works on **jsfeatNext**.
