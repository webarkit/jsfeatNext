# jsfeatNext

A testing repository to develop a ES6 version of [jsfeat](https://github.com/inspirit/jsfeat) for the WebARKit project. Consider that this is a test and many things may changes during the development. I will provide some examples for testing.

## List of features

- Typescript definitions

- ES6 support

- webpack bundler

- npm packages

## npm package
You can install the package with:

`npm install @webarkit/jsfeat-next`

Consider that the package is not well tested and many bugs may arise...

## Future features
Not all the original classes from jsfeat are yet implemented, this will be done in a near future.

## Examples
Go in the examples folder to test some of them.
